# 题目
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note:
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

## 思路
* 将两个排好序的数组进行再排序
* 使用归并排序的方法
* python中加一个print语句，会导致运行时间增长5-6倍
