# 题目
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

## 题目解读
* 给定一个字符串，判断是否是有效的回文字符串，也就是从左到右和从右到左是一样的，忽略大小写
* 从两端进行遍历，比较即可
