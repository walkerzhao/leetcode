# 题目
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
Some hints:
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

# 思路:
* 判断一个数字是不是回文数字，不用开辟额外的空间
* 将这个数字的逆序写出来，看看两个数字是否相等，来返回结果
